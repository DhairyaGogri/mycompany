# Testing guide

## Automated/local checks
1. Run a local HTTP server from the project root: `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/`.
3. Check that these pages load with HTTP 200: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `team.html`, `projects.html`, `tender-alignment.html`, `evidence-register.html`, `policies.html`, `privacy.html`, `contact.html`, `404.html`.
4. Check every same-site `href` target exists.

## Responsive checks
Use browser dev tools at approximately 375px, 768px, 1024px and 1440px widths. Check the header, tables, cards, map concept, form fields and footer for overflow or clipped content.

## Accessibility checks
Use keyboard-only navigation and confirm visible focus. Confirm the skip link works, menu button opens/closes on mobile, headings are logically ordered, form fields are labelled, and interactive controls have accessible names.

Run Lighthouse (Accessibility, Best Practices, Performance) or axe DevTools before submission. Fix any issues caused by deployment-specific services, fonts, analytics or contact forms added later.

## Content assurance
Before tender submission, verify the company number/address against the current corporate record, replace illustrative team profiles, confirm any project/reference claims, and add every certificate, policy, insurance limit and financial document actually required by the procurement documents.
